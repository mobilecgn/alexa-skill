## About the skill

*   Ask the skill when the last/next meetup is. (Currently in German only.)

## About the tech setup

*   This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   It is also recommended to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   Because AWS lambda uses Node 4.3 we use [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/)
    with the node preset to 'transpile' the JavaScript with
    [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to an compatible version.
*   TODO: Testing with Mocha or Jest.
*   We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) as linter with the
    [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guideline preset.

## Setup

### Preparation

*   Create an [Amazon Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/)
*   Create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
*   Create a [Meetup API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)

### Build the sourcecode

### Uplooad and configure your skill

        which means the string-identifier from the URL, not the internal ID.
